Notes on Reproducing the Analyses in this project
=================================================
Cleaning the accelerometer data in this repo requires a single R script, "run_analysis.R". A few additional (manual) manipulations are required; these can be found in "CodeBook.md". R version 2.15.3 was used for all analyses. All required files (save for the original data, see below) can be found in this repo.

Instructions for running the "run_analysis.R" script can be found in "CodeBook.md".
